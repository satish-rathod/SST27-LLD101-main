# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing OrderService class in SOLID/ex01 to comply with all SOLID principles while maintaining the current behavior. The current implementation violates multiple SOLID principles by having a single class handle tax calculation, email sending, and order persistence, creating tight coupling and making the code difficult to test and maintain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OrderService to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, so that each class has only one reason to change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current OrderService THEN the system SHALL identify that it handles multiple responsibilities (tax calculation, email sending, order persistence)
2. WHEN refactoring THEN each class SHALL have only one primary responsibility
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN tax calculation, email sending, and order persistence SHALL be handled by separate classes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow the Open/Closed Principle, so that new functionality can be added without modifying existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new tax calculation strategies THEN the system SHALL allow extension without modifying existing tax calculation code
2. WHEN adding new notification methods THEN the system SHALL allow extension without modifying existing notification code
3. WHEN adding new persistence mechanisms THEN the system SHALL allow extension without modifying existing persistence code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow the Liskov Substitution Principle, so that derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating interfaces or abstract classes THEN any implementation SHALL be substitutable without affecting the client code
2. WHEN using polymorphism THEN derived classes SHALL maintain the behavioral contract of their base classes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow the Interface Segregation Principle, so that classes are not forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating interfaces THEN each interface SHALL contain only methods that are relevant to its specific purpose
2. WHEN implementing interfaces THEN classes SHALL not be forced to implement methods they don't need
3. WHEN designing the system THEN interfaces SHALL be client-specific rather than general-purpose

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, so that high-level modules don't depend on low-level modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the OrderService THEN it SHALL depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
2. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection to provide concrete implementations
3. WHEN testing THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable due to abstraction-based design

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want the refactored code to maintain the same behavior as the original, so that functionality is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the refactored code THEN it SHALL produce the same output as the original Demo01 execution
2. WHEN calling checkout with "a@shop.com" and 100.0 THEN the system SHALL calculate tax at 18% rate
3. WHEN processing an order THEN the system SHALL send an email with the correct total and print the order storage message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a demonstration of the refactored code, so that I can verify the implementation works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the demo THEN it SHALL include the same test case as the original Demo01
2. WHEN running the demo THEN it SHALL demonstrate that the refactored code produces identical behavior
3. WHEN extending the demo THEN it SHALL show how the new design allows for easy testing and extension
