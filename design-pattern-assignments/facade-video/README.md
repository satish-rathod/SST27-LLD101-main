# Facade Pattern â€” Video Pipeline Solution

## Solution Overview
We refactored the video processing pipeline to use the **Facade** design pattern. The new `VideoProcessorFacade` class provides a simple interface for video processing, hiding the complexity of interacting with `Decoder`, `FilterEngine`, `Encoder`, and the legacy `LegacySharpen` API.

### What Changed
- **Created `VideoProcessorFacade`:**
  - Exposes a single `process(Path input, Path output, int sharpenStrength)` method.
  - Internally handles decoding, filtering (grayscale, scaling), legacy sharpening, and encoding.
  - Converts between frames and the legacy handle string as needed.
- **Updated `App.java`:**
  - Now uses only the facade for all video processing.
  - No direct use of subsystem classes or legacy API.

### How the Facade Pattern is Applied
The client (`App`) interacts only with the facade, which sequences all steps and adapts the legacy API internally. This reduces coupling and hides subsystem details from the client.

## How to Build & Run
```bash
cd facade-video/src
javac com/example/video/*.java
java com.example.video.App
```

## Notes
- The legacy sharpen step is simulated by converting frames to a handle and back.
- All subsystem details are hidden from the client.

**This solution demonstrates the Facade pattern by providing a unified, simple interface for a complex subsystem.**
